/*
 * ⚠️ BROKEN TOOL - ARCHIVED
 * 
 * This tool has been archived due to fundamental design flaws:
 * - Provides inaccurate status information despite claiming to scan codebase
 * - Many checks are hardcoded or use brittle heuristics
 * - No way to verify accuracy of assessments
 * - Inconsistent logic across different steps
 * - Fragile path resolution that breaks easily
 * - Misleading "evidence" system that gives false confidence
 * 
 * Archived: 2025-12-08
 * Reason: Fundamentally defective design, not worth fixing
