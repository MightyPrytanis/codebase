Middleboro-UI color system, palette, UX integration, and the design story (Oct 7, 2025)

This session documents:
- The complete Middleboro color palette and the personal stories behind each color
- The application of the palette to glass ocean and Piquette UIs
- A live animated React demo for palette and weather-aware UI
- Context: This project was a creative tangent, developed by David for a friend, but is being set aside to focus on higher-priority work (taxes)
- Project files and assets are in Middleboro-UI and relevant CSS/JSX code directories

Archived from conversation: defer reactivation until personal focus/time permits.
