## Archive Rationale

These documents were archived because:
1. They were superseded by final Inquisitor verification reports
2. They were one-shot status/progress reports that are no longer current
3. They contain historical information but are not authoritative for current status
4. Keeping them in the main docs directory creates confusion about current status

## Historical Value

These documents retain historical value for:
- Understanding the evolution of Priority 1-7 implementation
- Tracking fixes and improvements made during development
- Reference for similar future work
