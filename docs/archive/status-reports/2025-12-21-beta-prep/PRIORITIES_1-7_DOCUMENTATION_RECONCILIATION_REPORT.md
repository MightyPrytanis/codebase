## Archive Rationale

Documents were archived because:

1. **Superseded by Final Reports:** Initial assessments and progress reports were superseded by final Inquisitor verification reports
2. **One-Shot Status Reports:** Temporary status reports that are no longer current
3. **Redundancy:** Multiple documents covering the same status, with final verification being authoritative
4. **Confusion Prevention:** Keeping outdated documents in main directory creates confusion about current status

**Historical Value Preserved:**
- All archived documents retain historical value
- Archive README explains contents and rationale
- Documents remain accessible for reference
