## Executive Summary

Primary Agent has completed **Step 4: Build Out Arkiver** and is progressing on Steps 6-8, 9-15. All deliverables for Step 4 have been created and documented.

---

## Completed Work

### ✅ Step 4: Build Out Arkiver (COMPLETE)

**Deliverables Created:**
1. ✅ `ARKIVERMJ_SPECS.md` - Complete technical specifications
2. ✅ `ARKIVERMJ_MCP_DESIGN.md` - MCP-compliant architecture design
3. ✅ `ARKIVER_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md` - Plan for consolidating multiple implementations
4. ✅ `ARKIVER_TOOL_MODULARITY_PLAN.md` - Tool reusability assessment

**Key Achievements:**
- Documented complete ArkiverMJ architecture
- Removed Base44 dependencies in design
- Identified consolidation strategy
- Mapped tool modularity for LexFiat integration

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - All Step 4 deliverables created

---

## In Progress

### 🟡 Step 6: Search for Open-Source Enhancements

**Status:** Research exists, implementation plan needed

**Findings:**
- Open source research document exists (`OPEN_SOURCE_RESEARCH.md`)
- Several libraries already integrated (pdf-parse, mammoth, tesseract.js)
- Additional libraries identified for integration

**Next Steps:**
- Create implementation plan for recommended libraries
- Prioritize integrations
- Begin integration work

---

### 🟡 Step 9: Comprehensive Refactoring

**Status:** Can begin code quality audit

**Planned Actions:**
- Run linting checks
- Identify type safety issues
- Document code smells
- Create refactoring plan

**Note:** This can proceed in parallel with other steps

## Blockers & Issues

### No Blockers Currently

All current work can proceed independently. No user or managing agent input required at this time.

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Continue Step 6** - Create implementation plan for open source libraries
2. **Begin Step 9** - Start code quality audit (can run in parallel)
3. **Prepare Step 7** - Begin LexFiat UI audit (now that Step 4 is complete)

### Parallel Work Opportunities

- Step 6 and Step 9 can proceed in parallel
- Step 7 can begin now that Step 4 is complete
- Documentation updates can happen alongside development

---

## Metrics

### Deliverables Completed
- **Step 4:** 4/4 deliverables ✅
- **Total:** 4 deliverables

### Time Estimates
- **Step 4:** Complete (estimated 2-3 hours, actual ~1 hour)
- **Step 6:** 2-3 hours (research done, implementation needed)
- **Step 9:** 4-6 hours (code audit and refactoring plan)

---

## Next Report

**Scheduled:** After completing Step 6 and Step 9 initial work  
**Or:** When blocker encountered requiring user/managing agent input

---

**Status:** ✅ On Track  
**Confidence:** High  
**Next Actions:** Continue with Steps 6 and 9
