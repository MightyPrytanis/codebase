Extract, parse, index, and make sense of massive amounts of user data across multiple formats and sources, enabling intelligent search and analysis.

### Key Features (Planned)
- **Multi-Format Processing**: Handle documents, emails, PDFs, spreadsheets, databases, APIs, and unstructured text
- **Intelligent Extraction**: AI-powered content analysis and metadata generation
- **Semantic Indexing**: Create searchable knowledge graphs from raw data
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify trends, relationships, and insights across large datasets
- **Privacy-First Architecture**: Local processing with optional user-controlled cloud sync
- **Real-Time Processing**: Stream processing for continuous data ingestion

### Core Values Alignment
- **Factual Accuracy**: Preserve data integrity throughout parsing and indexing
- **Truth**: Maintain source attribution and provenance tracking
- **User Sovereignty**: Complete user control over data processing and storage
- **Efficiency**: Fast parallel processing using distributed architecture
- **Economy**: Cost-effective processing using local compute when possible
- **Effectiveness**: Measurable improvement in data accessibility and insights

### Technology Stack
- MAE: multi-AI provider integration for content analysis
- Real-time processing pipeline architecture
- Database schema design patterns
- Authentication and access control systems
- Weightless UI for data visualization
- "Universal Indexer" module
- Journeyman forensic reconstruction Engine


### Use Cases
1. **Legal Discovery**: Process massive document collections for litigation
2. **Research Analytics**: Academic paper analysis and knowledge extraction
3. **Business Intelligence**: Corporate data lake analysis and reporting
4. **Personal Knowledge Management**: Organize and search personal information. If you say, *"I want to know the exact day I first met John. It was warm and muggy; it rained the night before. I know it was in April or May 2023, but that's all I remember."*  Arkiver will virtually reconstruct the entire day in question--every email, every appointment, every instant message or text--using every type of data available to it, down to the hour-by-hour temperature chart, what time you got to Kalamazoo, and what you listened to on Spotify both before and after the moment that changed everything.
5. **Compliance Monitoring**: Automated regulatory document processing
6. **Content Creation**: Extract insights for writing and content development.
7. **Workflow Archaeology**: Arkiver's powerful tools allow you to examine and improve your processes at an atomic level. Identify and understand helpful and harmful habits, bottlenecks, and when your team does their best work.

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Ingestion**: Multi-source data collection with format detection
2. **Parsing**: AI-assisted content extraction and structure recognition
3. **Analysis**: Semantic understanding and relationship mapping
4. **Indexing**: Searchable knowledge graph creation
5. **Querying**: Natural language search and insight generation
6. **Export**: Structured data output in multiple formats

### Privacy & Security
- **Local-First Processing**: No data leaves user environment unless explicitly authorized
- **Encryption**: All data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Access Controls**: Granular permissions for data sharing and collaboration
- **Audit Trails**: Complete tracking of data access and modifications

### Development Priority
**HIGH** - Essential for handling the exponential growth of data in modern organizations and personal workflows.

### Integration Points
- Extends SwimMeet's real-time processing capabilities
- Uses established authentication and security frameworks
- Leverages existing AI provider orchestration
- Builds on database design patterns
