# Monorepo Directory

**Status:** Premature - Created before correct workflow phase

**Note:** This directory was created prematurely. According to the correct workflow:

1. Finish work on local `/codebase` (current phase)
2. Prelim testing/debugging
3. Pre-beta demo builds (successful)
4. Upload to GitHub's codebase repo (replace existing version)
5. THEN audit
6. THEN final merge of repos
7. THEN final testing/demo builds/debugging
8. THEN anything else
9. THEN beta release

**Monorepo creation and restructuring happens AFTER upload, audit, and final merge.**

This directory structure should not be used until the correct phase in the workflow.

---

**Date:** 2025-11-26  
**Action:** This directory structure is documented as premature and will be created properly later in the workflow.
