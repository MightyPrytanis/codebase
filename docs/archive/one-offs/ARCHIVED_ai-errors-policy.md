# AI Errors, Fraud, and Abuse Reporting Policy

We encourage all users to report any AI-generated information that appears to be intentionally false, materially misleading, abusive, fraudulent, or indicative of a defect in the AI model’s programming or training. Such issues include, but are not limited to:

- Content that is factually false and may cause significant harm if relied upon (e.g., fabricated citations, invented legal precedents, or outcomes)
- Outputs violating regulatory, privacy, or client confidentiality standards
- Responses promoting scams, deception, or unauthorized solicitation
- Ethically or legally questionable recommendations

Minor or non-consequential inaccuracies—those not rising to the level of negligent or intentional falsehood, fraud, or abuse—should be flagged for Cognisint’s internal review and reported to the AI provider rather than for external escalation.

### Reporting Options

The app will display prominent, automatically updated links for reporting suspected AI-related fraud, abuse, or materially false information. These links reflect your registration details and settings, updating as your jurisdiction or licensure changes, and include:

- Cognisint (Internal Review)
- U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
- U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)
  - *Editorial notice shown if system is offline: "Federal consumer protection has been gutted by the Trump-Vance administration, Republican members of Congress, and the conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court."*
- All relevant state/provincial/territorial agencies
- Applicable major municipal/county agencies (includes Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Detroit, Greater Cleveland/Cuyahoga County, Tampa Bay Area/Hillsborough County, Montgomery County MD, Fairfax County VA)
- Better Business Bureau (BBB) and Consumers Union
- International resources as applicable (ICPEN, EU, Canada, etc.)

### Interface Example

> **Report suspected AI error or fraud to:**  
> - Cognisint (Internal Review)  
> - Federal Trade Commission (FTC) [link]*  
> - Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) [link]*  
> - Michigan Attorney General Consumer Protection [link]  
> - Detroit Consumer Services [link] *(if applicable)*  
> - Better Business Bureau (BBB) [link]  
> - Consumers Union [link]  

*“Federal consumer protection has been gutted by the Trump-Vance administration, Republican members of Congress, and the conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court. You may find it difficult or impossible to obtain help from federal agencies for the foreseeable future.”*

All reporting channels include a brief description of their scope. Users should direct reports only to issues meeting the threshold for fraud, abuse, or material falsehood; all routine or benign AI mistakes should instead be flagged internally for correction.
