# Step 13: Reconciliation Status Check
**Date:** 2025-11-26  
**Status:** NEEDS VERIFICATION  
**Purpose:** Determine if Step 13 special agent work is complete

---

## Current Status

**Question:** Is Step 13 (Reconciliation) special agent work complete?

**Evidence Found:**
- ✅ `STEP_13_RECONCILIATION_PLAN.md` exists - Plan created
- ✅ `STEP_13_REMAINING_FILES.md` exists - Remaining files documented
- ⚠️ Status unclear - Need to verify if work is actually done

---

## What Step 13 Should Include

### Part 1: Review Existing Reconciliation ✅
- Files already merged from GitHub (6 services, 1 tool, 4 docs)
- Verification that merged files are present

### Part 2: Remaining Files Review ⚠️
- High priority: Modified files needing comparison
- Medium priority: Unique files to evaluate
- Low priority: Documentation updates

**Note:** Monorepo creation happens later in the workflow (after upload, audit, final merge). Step 13 focuses ONLY on file reconciliation.

---

## Files to Check

1. **`STEP_13_RECONCILIATION_PLAN.md`** - Plan exists
2. **`STEP_13_REMAINING_FILES.md`** - Remaining work documented
3. **`RECONCILIATION_LOG.md`** - Should show what was merged
4. **GitHub repos** - Need to compare file versions (not create monorepo)

---

## Verification Needed

### ✅ Can Verify:
- Plan documents exist
- Some files were merged (per RECONCILIATION_LOG.md)

### ❓ Need to Verify:
- Are all remaining files reviewed?
- Is reconciliation actually complete?
- What work remains?
- Have file comparisons been done?

---

## Action Required

**Next Step:** Review `STEP_13_RECONCILIATION_PLAN.md` and `STEP_13_REMAINING_FILES.md` to determine:
1. What work was completed
2. What work remains
3. Whether special agent is actually done

**Status:** ⚠️ UNCLEAR - Needs verification
