## AI Errors, Fraud, and Abuse Reporting Policy

We encourage all users to report any AI-generated information that appears to be intentionally false, materially misleading, abusive, fraudulent, or indicative of a defect in the AI model’s programming or training. Typical concerns include:

- Content that is factually false and may cause significant harm if relied upon (e.g., fabricated citations, invented legal precedents, etc.)
- Outputs that violate regulatory, privacy, or client confidentiality requirements
- Responses promoting scams, deception, or unauthorized solicitation
- Ethically or legally questionable recommendations

Minor or non-consequential inaccuracies should be flagged for Cognisint’s internal review and for reporting to the AI provider.  Escalation to third parties, including government agencies, is warranted chiefly for cases rising to the level of negligent or intentional falsehood, fraud, or abuse.

Unless you or another person is in imminent danger, do not call 911 or any other emergency line regarding AI errors. Emergency dispatch lines must be kept clear for life-threatening and other serious emergencies.

## Reporting Options

Prominent, automatically updated links will be displayed for reporting suspected AI-related fraud, abuse, or materially false information. These links reflect your registration details and update as your jurisdiction or licensure changes:

- **Cognisint (Internal Review):**  
  For initial review of content quality or safety concerns.
- **U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC):**  
  For reporting AI/business-related unfair, deceptive, or fraudulent practices (or the equivalent for non-U.S. users).
- **U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB):**  
  For financial AI complaints.  
  Note: *Federal consumer protection has been gutted by the Trump-Vance administration, Republican members of Congress, and the conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court. You may find it difficult or impossible to obtain help from federal agencies for the foreseeable future.*
- **All applicable state, provincial, territorial, district, or commonwealth agencies**
- **Major municipal or county agencies:**  
  Including Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Detroit, Cuyahoga County (Greater Cleveland), Hillsborough County (Tampa Bay Area), Montgomery County (MD), Fairfax County (VA).
- **Better Business Bureau (BBB) and Consumers Union:**  
  For non-governmental consumer advocacy.
- **International resources as applicable (ICPEN, EU, Canada, etc.)**
