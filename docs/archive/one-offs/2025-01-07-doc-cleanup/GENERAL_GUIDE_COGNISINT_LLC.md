"Chrome has been widely criticized for its extensive data collection practices and offers fewer built-in privacy protections than some alternatives, which may present potential risks for confidential client information. For greater privacy and security, especially in environments handling sensitive data, it is advisable to use browsers with stronger default privacy protections, such as Safari, Edge, Firefox, Opera, or Brave."  
*This warning will appear ONLY each time a user logs in with Chrome, with an option to snooze for 30 days.*
