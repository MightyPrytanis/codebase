STATE OF MICHIGAN
IN THE SIXTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT COURT, OAKLAND COUNTY
FAMILY DIVISION

LISA JOHNSON,
    Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant,
v
MICHAEL JOHNSON,
    Defendant/Counter-Plaintiff.

Case No. 2025-190234-DM
Hon. Kameshia D. Gant

DRAFT RESPONSE TO EMERGENCY MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER

NOW COMES Defendant/Counter-Plaintiff, Michael Johnson (“Mr. Johnson”), by his attorney Mekel S. Miller, and for his Response to Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant’s Emergency Motion for Temporary Restraining Order states as follows:

I. INTRODUCTION
This response is provided for attorney input and further development prior to filing. Sections highlighted for supplementation are marked with an asterisk (*).

II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
1. Mr. Johnson denies Plaintiff’s account of alleged abuse and improper asset transfers, and maintains that his actions have been within the bounds of Michigan law and current court orders.
2. At all relevant times, Mr. Johnson asserts he acted transparently regarding finances and made no efforts to dissipate marital assets or circumvent court oversight.
*Counsel: Consider adding factual detail or reference to documentation, as needed.*

III. LEGAL STANDARD AND ARGUMENT
Under MCR 3.310 and Michigan law, a temporary restraining order may only issue where Plaintiff demonstrates imminent irreparable harm, a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, and that other remedies at law are inadequate.
See Michigan Coalition of State Employee Unions v Civil Service Comm’n, 465 Mich 212 (2001); Alliance for the Mentally Ill v Dept of Cmty Health, 231 Mich App 647 (1998).

1. Absence of Irreparable Harm:
Plaintiff’s motion lacks evidence of immediate, non-remediable harm. Mr. Johnson neither threatens nor intends to dissipate assets, and no credible threat to Plaintiff justifies extraordinary relief at this stage.
*Counsel: Supplement with affidavits, account evidence, or responsive screenshots where appropriate.*

2. Likelihood of Success:
Plaintiff’s allegations remain unsubstantiated and seem intended to gain leverage rather than redress true imminent danger or risk. The record to date does not support her claims as required for ex parte or emergency relief.
*Counsel: Add further analysis, e.g. treatment of asset movement in similar Oakland County cases, details from case file or hearing transcript.*

3. Hardship and Public Interest:
Restraining Mr. Johnson from standard financial conduct or contact with his children based solely on Plaintiff’s allegations would unduly prejudice him absent a complete hearing on the merits.
*Counsel: Expand if specific parenting time or asset freeze language is at issue.*

IV. CONCLUSION
For these reasons, Mr. Johnson respectfully requests that the Court deny Plaintiff’s requested Temporary Restraining Order and schedule an evidentiary hearing at the Court’s convenience.

Respectfully submitted,
