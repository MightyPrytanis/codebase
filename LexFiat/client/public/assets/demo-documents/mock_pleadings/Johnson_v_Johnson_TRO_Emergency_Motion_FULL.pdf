STATE OF MICHIGAN
IN THE SIXTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT COURT, OAKLAND COUNTY
FAMILY DIVISION

LISA JOHNSON,
    Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant,
v
MICHAEL JOHNSON,
    Defendant/Counter-Plaintiff.

Case No. 2025-190234-DM
Hon. Kameshia D. Gant

EMERGENCY MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER

Plaintiff, Lisa Johnson (“Mrs. Johnson”), by her attorney Debra N. Ribitwer, and with a deep sense of urgency and heartbreak, respectfully begs this Honorable Court to step in NOW and protect her, her children, and the home she has so carefully built over the last 17 years. In support, Mrs. Johnson states as follows:

I. “WHAT SHE HAS BEEN FORCED TO ENDURE”
1. Since their marriage, Mrs. Johnson has poured her heart and soul into her family, only to be met by a husband who has—on countless occasions—yelled, berated, and, on more than one occasion, threatened her with “ruin” if she ever tried to leave.
2. Just last July, after a dinner that Mrs. Johnson spent hours preparing, Mr. Johnson screamed so loudly at her for “forgetting the salad” that their youngest child cried herself to sleep. How can any mother forget her child’s sobs?
3. The threats escalated. On August 14, after a brief argument in their driveway, Mrs. Johnson recalls Mr. Johnson whispering, “You’ll regret crossing me. You have no idea who you are messing with.” Mrs. Johnson has not slept properly since.
4. Michael Johnson, fully aware that his wife has no access to their complicated finances, began cashing out investment accounts in September, moving sums to accounts in the Turks and Caicos—because, as he loudly told Mrs. Johnson, “I’m not letting you touch a dime of MY money.”
5. Mrs. Johnson has tried to protect her family with quiet dignity, but the relentless humiliation and fear are now too much for one woman to bear. The financial secrets are just the tip of a very sinister iceberg.

II. “EVERY DAY MEANS ANOTHER NIGHT OF FEAR”
6. Mrs. Johnson pleads with the Court to simply imagine her position: terrified, watching her husband siphon funds every day she delays, and falling asleep wondering if tonight will be the night Mr. Johnson finally “loses it” for real.
7. The evidence isn’t just in Mrs. Johnson’s words, but in the sadness of her children, the look in her neighbors’ eyes, and the “please stay safe” texts from friends after yet another shouting match shakes the block.
8. Mrs. Johnson is not a lawyer; she’s a woman who has had enough, and now she comes to this Court not with fancy statutes, but with exhausted hands outstretched—asking for protection before something truly irreversible happens.

III. “DON’T LET HIM GET AWAY WITH THIS”
9. Mrs. Johnson believes—with every fiber of her being—that if the Court does not act, all that she and her children have left will be lost. The money gone to the Caribbean, the home at risk, and safety a distant memory.
10. The law, as far as Mrs. Johnson understands it, gives her at least the right not to be terrorized or left destitute by a man who has made it clear he will stop at nothing to “win.”
11. Sometimes, Your Honor, the truth is written not in legal books, but in a mother’s tears.

IV. PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Mrs. Johnson begs this Court, with all possible urgency and hope, to:
- Forbid Michael Johnson from moving, spending, or hiding any marital money, especially what’s already headed to the Turks and Caicos,
- Order him to stay away—physically and electronically—from Mrs. Johnson, her children, and their home,
- Set this for a hearing as swiftly as your docket allows, for the sake of Mrs. Johnson’s sanity and her children’s well-being.

Respectfully submitted,
