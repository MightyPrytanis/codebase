# LexFiat Forecaster™

**LexFiat Forecaster™** is a standalone application for generating hypothetical forecasts for tax returns, child support orders, and QDROs (Qualified Domestic Relations Orders).

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

All forecasts generated by LexFiat Forecaster™ are **hypothetical and not filing-ready**. They must be reviewed and finalized by qualified professionals before any filing or use in legal proceedings.

## Features

- **Tax Return Forecasts**: Generate hypothetical tax return forecasts using IRS forms and calculations (2018-2025)
- **Child Support Forecasts**: Calculate hypothetical child support scenarios using state-specific formulas (Michigan FOC formula)
- **QDRO Forecasts**: Generate hypothetical QDRO division scenarios with ERISA compliance

## Branding

LexFiat Forecaster™ applies mandatory branding strips or watermarks to all generated forecasts:
- **Default**: Warning strip at top of each page
- **Licensed Attorneys**: Can override with risk acknowledgement (watermark or no branding)
- **Non-Attorneys**: Branding cannot be removed
