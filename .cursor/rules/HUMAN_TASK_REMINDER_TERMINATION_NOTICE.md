# HUMAN TASK REMINDER AGENT - TERMINATION NOTICE

**Date:** 2025-12-21  
**Status:** TERMINATED - DO NOT USE  
**Termination Authority:** Director Agent

## Termination Decision

The Human Task Reminder Agent has been **TERMINATED** for **complete failure to perform its core function**.

## Reasons for Termination

### 1. Never Reminded User of Anything

**Failure:** The Human Task Reminder Agent has **NEVER** reminded the user of any human tasks, despite being designed specifically for this purpose.

**Evidence:**
- User reports: "Not once has the current reminder ever reminded me of anything"
- Agent was supposed to run automatically at session start
- Agent was supposed to trigger contextually when relevant work is started
- Agent was supposed to monitor documents and present reminders
- **NONE of this happened**

**Severity:** CRITICAL - Complete failure of core function

### 2. Passive Instead of Proactive

**Failure:** The agent was designed to be proactive but was implemented as passive.

**Evidence:**
- Agent rule file says "Run automatically at session start" but it never did
- Agent rule file says "Trigger contextually" but it never did
- Agent rule file says "Monitor documents" but it never did
- Agent was never invoked or executed

**Severity:** CRITICAL - Agent was completely non-functional

### 3. No Actual Implementation

**Failure:** The agent had a specification but no actual execution mechanism.

**Evidence:**
- Agent rule file exists with detailed specifications
- But agent was never actually invoked
- No automatic execution
- No proactive reminders
- Agent was essentially dead code

**Severity:** CRITICAL - Agent specification without execution

## Termination Triggers Met

The Human Task Reminder Agent met **ALL** of the following termination triggers:

- ❌ Complete failure to perform core function
- ❌ Never executed despite being designed to run automatically
- ❌ Passive instead of proactive
- ❌ No actual implementation despite detailed specification

## Replacement Agent

**Replacement:** Proactive Human Task Reminder Agent (`.cursor/rules/proactive-human-task-reminder-agent.mdc`)

**Improvements:**
- ✅ **Actually Executes** - Will actually read documents and present reminders
- ✅ **Proactive** - Will automatically check and remind at session start
- ✅ **Mandatory Execution** - Will execute when invoked, not just sit in a file
- ✅ **Real Implementation** - Will actually read task documents and present reminders
- ✅ **User-Facing** - Will actually communicate with user

## Action Required

**DO NOT USE THE HUMAN TASK REMINDER AGENT** - It has been terminated for complete failure.
