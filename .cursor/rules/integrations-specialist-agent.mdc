## Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Direct Import (TypeScript/Node.js)

**Best For:** Same codebase, TypeScript applications

```typescript
// In LexFiat or other TypeScript app
import { PDFExtractor } from '@cyrano/modules/arkiver/extractors/pdf-extractor.js';
import { EntityProcessor } from '@cyrano/modules/arkiver/processors/entity-processor.js';

// Use directly with error handling
try {
  const extractor = new PDFExtractor();
  const result = await extractor.extract(filePath);
  return result;
} catch (error) {
  // Handle error gracefully
  return { error: error.message };
}
```

**Performance Considerations:**
- No network overhead
- Type safety
- Direct access
- Consider connection pooling for resource-intensive operations

**Resilience Considerations:**
- Handle file system errors
- Handle memory errors
- Handle processing errors
- Implement timeout for long operations

### Pattern 2: MCP Protocol (External Apps)

**Best For:** External applications, different languages

```typescript
// Via MCP client with retry logic
async function callMCPToolWithRetry(
  tool: string,
  args: Record<string, any>,
  maxRetries = 3
): Promise<CallToolResult> {
  for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      const result = await mcpClient.callTool(tool, args);
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      if (attempt === maxRetries) throw error;
      await sleep(Math.pow(2, attempt) * 1000); // Exponential backoff
    }
  }
}
```

**Performance Considerations:**
- Network overhead (minimize round trips)
- Connection pooling
- Request batching
- Efficient serialization

**Resilience Considerations:**
- Retry with exponential backoff
- Circuit breaker for repeated failures
- Timeout handling
- Graceful error messages

### Pattern 3: HTTP REST API

**Best For:** Web applications, mobile apps

```typescript
// Via HTTP with resilience
async function executeCyranoTool(
  tool: string,
  args: Record<string, any> = {}
): Promise<CyranoToolResult> {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}/mcp/execute`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ tool, arguments: args }),
      signal: AbortSignal.timeout(30000), // 30s timeout
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      return {
        content: [{ type: 'text', text: `Service unavailable (${response.status})` }],
        isError: true,
        _serviceUnavailable: true,
      };
    }

    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    // Network error - return gracefully
    return {
      content: [{ type: 'text', text: `Network error: ${error.message}` }],
      isError: true,
      _networkError: true,
    };
  }
}
```

**Performance Considerations:**
- Connection reuse (HTTP keep-alive)
- Request compression
- Response caching
- Minimize payload size

**Resilience Considerations:**
- Timeout handling
- Retry logic
- Circuit breaker
- Graceful degradation
- User-friendly error messages
