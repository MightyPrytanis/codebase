Detect and measure ideological bias, political slant, and factual distortion in AI responses to maintain truth and accuracy standards.

### Key Features (Planned)
- **Bias Detection Engine**: Analyze AI responses for ideological positioning across multiple political/social spectrums
- **Factual Accuracy Scoring**: Cross-reference claims against verified data sources
- **Drift Tracking**: Monitor how AI models change their responses over time
- **Comparative Analysis**: Side-by-side comparison of multiple AI providers' responses to identical prompts
- **Truth Anchoring**: Maintain baseline factual references for controversial topics

### Core Values Alignment
- **Factual Accuracy**: Primary focus on distinguishing facts from opinions
- **Truth**: Absolute commitment to identifying verifiable information
- **User Sovereignty**: Users control their information diet and bias awareness
- **Efficiency**: Quick, automated bias detection without manual review
- **Economy**: Cost-effective truth verification using existing AI infrastructure
- **Effectiveness**: Measurable improvement in information quality

### Technology Stack (Inherited from SwimMeet)
- Multi-AI provider integration for cross-validation
