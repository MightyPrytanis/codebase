# Universal Indexer

## Large Data Parsing and Intelligence Extraction

### Core Mission
Extract, parse, index, and make sense of massive amounts of user data across multiple formats and sources, enabling intelligent search and analysis.

### Key Features (Planned)
- **Multi-Format Processing**: Handle documents, emails, PDFs, spreadsheets, databases, APIs, and unstructured text
- **Intelligent Extraction**: AI-powered content analysis and metadata generation
- **Semantic Indexing**: Create searchable knowledge graphs from raw data
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify trends, relationships, and insights across large datasets
- **Privacy-First Architecture**: Local processing with optional user-controlled cloud sync
- **Real-Time Processing**: Stream processing for continuous data ingestion

### Core Values Alignment
- **Factual Accuracy**: Preserve data integrity throughout parsing and indexing
- **Truth**: Maintain source attribution and provenance tracking
- **User Sovereignty**: Complete user control over data processing and storage
- **Efficiency**: Fast parallel processing using distributed architecture
- **Economy**: Cost-effective processing using local compute when possible
- **Effectiveness**: Measurable improvement in data accessibility and insights

### Technology Stack (Inherited from SwimMeet)
- Multi-AI provider integration for content analysis
- Real-time processing pipeline architecture
- Database schema design patterns
- Authentication and access control systems
- Industrial UI for data visualization

### Use Cases
1. **Legal Discovery**: Process massive document collections for litigation
2. **Research Analytics**: Academic paper analysis and knowledge extraction
3. **Business Intelligence**: Corporate data lake analysis and reporting
4. **Personal Knowledge Management**: Organize and search personal information
5. **Compliance Monitoring**: Automated regulatory document processing
6. **Content Creation**: Extract insights for writing and content development

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Ingestion**: Multi-source data collection with format detection
2. **Parsing**: AI-assisted content extraction and structure recognition
3. **Analysis**: Semantic understanding and relationship mapping
4. **Indexing**: Searchable knowledge graph creation
5. **Querying**: Natural language search and insight generation
6. **Export**: Structured data output in multiple formats

### Privacy & Security
- **Local-First Processing**: No data leaves user environment unless explicitly authorized
- **Encryption**: All data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Access Controls**: Granular permissions for data sharing and collaboration
- **Audit Trails**: Complete tracking of data access and modifications

### Development Priority
