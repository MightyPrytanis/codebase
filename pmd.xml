        Minimal PMD ruleset - PMD is disabled in .codacy.yml but this file
        prevents "No rules found" errors during Codacy initialization.
        This repository is TypeScript/React based and does not contain Java code.

    <!-- Even though disabled, Codacy sometimes initializes PMD and requires at least one rule -->
